<h1>Final Course Project

<h5>For the final project in this course, you will be tasked with demonstrating the skills that you’ve learned throughout this certificate program. Your job will be to construct a full-functioning and interactive website that demonstrates all of the skills that you’ve acquired throughout this course. These skills include basic and intermediate HTML5 authoring skills, CSS3 structuring, formatting, and interactive skills, third-party framework usage, Responsive Web Design, JavaScript and jQuery, Forms, and more. The completed team-based project will be a culmination of everything you’ve learned and in order to receive maximum points (200), the successful team should make sure that their completed project touches on the points outlined in the following rubric.

PointsDescription

10 Your project’s folder structure should be well thought out. This will include appropriate folder names including assets, css, js, images, etc. HTML files should appear within the root of the project. The HTML documents should be formatted according to HTML5 standards. The HTML5 shiv library should be referenced as well as the normalize.css library. (*Do not include any items within your directory structure that are not needed for your site to function).

15 Your markup should use HTML5 section elements for structure and grouping and inline text-level semantic elements for everything else. As it relates to structure, make sure to use header, nav, section, footer, aside, and address tags where applicable. Of course you may use them more than once and of course, they can be nested within each other. The navigation menu should have a minimum of 5 links, constructed using an unordered list, and some kind of “fly out” must be implemented that outlines at least 5 more links for a total of 10 web pages minimum. You can achieve this menu by using CSS3. The HTML should be properly commented so that the instructor may quickly see the different areas of the document. Use a validator to ensure code is error free.

10 The website should include a minimum of 10 web pages. Each web page should link seamlessly between each other with no broken links (internal or external). At least 1 mailto: link should appear somewhere within the website. At least 3 images must appear on the website. This does not include any backgrounds that you may decide to add within CSS.10Incorporate at least 1 Web Font to the website. Make sure to provide appropriate fall-back content.

10 CSS should be implemented to define the structure and formatting of the website. An external style sheet should be created and properly linked into each page of the website. No embedded or inline styles should be defined. You must utilize 7 selector types which may include IDs, classes, descendant, type, pseudo-class, sibling, adjacent sibling, etc. The CSS should be properly commented so that the instructor may quickly see the different areas of the document. Use a validator to ensure code is error free.

10 The website is properly formatted with CSS. This includes relying on background colors and images, font weights, line heights, colors, and more to make the website’s appearance stand out. Make sure that your website seperates out structure form visual design and assigns each to the appropriate area of the site.

10 The website is properly structured with CSS. This includes relying on the box model properties to set dimensions including widths, heights, paddings, margins, borders, etc. (use shorthand whenever possible). Correct use of selector types must be demonstrated. All CSS should be free of errors. 10The CSS should be organized and optimized. You will need to create a minified version of your CSS for deployment but make sure you also have a un-minified version that contains comments and is well organized. Please have your submitted project reference the un-minified version of the CSS but do include minified versions of all CSS files that you would be using at deployment.

30 At least 3 uses of jQuery should be used to add interactivity to your website, you can create custom code or use a plugin). For instance you might decide to have a carousel of images on the main page, an accordion to show/hide testimonials, collapsible panels, a to top image that jumps the user back up to the top of the web page, etc. Be creative here but you must have at least 3 jQuery plugins. Make sure the jQuery you choose to incorporate is appropriate for your website. 

20
A contact form exists. The contact form includes the following form controls:
At least 1 fieldset and legend used
At least 4 text boxes
At least 1 set of radio buttons
At least 1 set of checkboxes
At least 1 drop down menu
At least 1 list box
At least 1 multiline textarea
1 Submit button

The form should use the new HTML5 Constraint Validation API and take advantage of the required and pattern attributes where applicable. The new CSS3 selectors should be used to style valid and invalid submissions. The label element should be used for accessibility and usability and should be associated with each control. Essentially you will have 1 label element for each control you add.
Note: The action for the form does not have to be set. We are only designing the front-end here. However, you can earn up to 20 points extra credit if you create a functioning form (use PHP to handle processing of the form)

25The website should be completely responsive. In order to receive maximum points here the website should be fully functional in all device views including desktop, tablet, and smart phones. It is at the instructor’s discretion to determine if all 3 website views were successfully achieved. You may add media queries to your CSS in order to achieve the responsiveness or you may use Skeleton or the Grid System in Bootstrap to achieve this. No other framework will be considered. If you do decide to use Bootstrap, only the grid system will be evaluated. Any other classes should be your own and not point to existing Bootstrap helper classes. Make sure to code your website so it uses the mobile first approach and uses the strategy of progressive enhancement.

10Your website should be spell checked, should pass validation and should contain actual content (no placeholder content).

10Make sure that your website contains appropriate meta data, also make sure to code your website so it is search engine friendly. Make sure that all web content is structured for optimum web readability, scan-ability and use.

20Project presentation (presentation checklist)
 
Submit your zipped folder with all of the necessary components (only include the necessary components for this page, do not put anything else in your folder) to the assignments section, please name your folder' groupName_FEWD1-final', (for example my folder would be called codeClub_FEWD1-final). Make sure in the note portion of blackboard you include all team member's names. only 1 submission per group is necessary.

Individually each group member will submit a typed summary of the experience with the group project, talk about what you liked and didn't like, what went smoothly, what didn't. What did you learn from this process? Please make sure to review your team members strengths and weaknesses? How was it to work with each person? As a group did you work well together? Did each person give maximum effort to the project? ** please note that only I will be seeing this so please be honest in your assessments of the project.
Each group will be presenting their project to the class. Review the presentation checklist to ensure that your presentation goes smoothly and you have all necessary parts of the project ready to share with the class.
